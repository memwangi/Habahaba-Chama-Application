# Habahaba-Chama-Application
I've hosted this project [here ](chamaapp.heroku.com). I had an idea of a Chama portal. A chama is a micro savings group in Kenya.
Through this app, a user can create a chama, join one,make payments, view their transactions in all the chamas they belong to, request loans,
see any upcoming meetings etc.
